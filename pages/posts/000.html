      <p>Hello world!<p>

      <p>This is my first post in a blog that a hunch says will last a while.</p>

      <p>
        I'm writing this entirely in base html/CSS/javascript; so no funny business. 
        In a day of frameworks and libraries galore, I wanted to challenge myself by making this site in this way. 
        It also doubles as a creative outlet, where I can spew whatever random thoughts I have.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        But I'm not sure how scalable this blog will end up being. I may look back at my decision to NOT use a framework as a sore mistake-alas, it may be so.
        But I didn't write this blog to have fancy features or login accounts or dynamic graphs or whatever else may be; I made it to be written in.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a strange itch for accuracy, which means making quick claims is something I'm not wont to do. I hate the idea of telling a lie, and worse,
        I'd hate the feeling embarrasing of being wrong. That said, I have a quick thought on html.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that will have to be next time. My break is over, and I have to return to work.
